# Admin Page Patterns

Use this reference before designing common SaaS admin pages. Pick the page type first, then compose the screen from Forge components instead of hand-rolling UI.

Think in reusable page blocks, similar to shadcn Blocks: shell, toolbar, data body, feedback state, and confirmation flow. Prefer real Forge cases/templates as the source of truth.

## Page Selection Decision Tree

Before composing JSX, choose the page model:

1. If the request asks for a system/platform/admin/back-office, read `contracts/system-brief.md`, choose a `blueprints/*.md` archetype, and produce a System Brief before choosing page components.
2. If the request names a business object users manage, treat it as a resource module and read `contracts/module-contract.md` plus `admin-module-playbook.md` first.
3. If the user asks for metrics, trends, anomalies, or reports, start with analytics/reporting, then add drill-down links to lists/details.
4. If the user asks for approval, generation, import, publishing, tickets, or review, model a workflow queue with explicit states and actions.
5. If the user asks for settings, permissions, integrations, notifications, or rules, model grouped configuration with save/reset behavior and danger zones.
6. If the page mixes multiple intents, give each intent a clear surface: dashboard for insight, list/detail for operations, settings for configuration.

Pick the nearest Forge template after the page model is clear. For example, ecommerce products/orders/customers are good CRUD references; project-template projects/members/files/invoices/tasks are good operational module references; dashboards are good entry pages, not replacements for CRUD flows.

When a blueprint exists, prefer its module map and state model over inventing generic fields. The page pattern decides the surface; the blueprint decides the business logic.

For system generation, combine patterns instead of picking only one: app shell + workbench/dashboard + core list/detail + mutation form/dialog + settings/audit/supporting surface.

## Universal Admin Skeleton

1. Wrap the page in `<AppLayout>`.
2. Build navigation from business domains: dashboard/workbench, operations, relationships, output/finance, governance/settings.
3. Use `pageHeaderVariant="home"` for dashboard/list pages and `pageHeaderVariant="detail"` for detail/create/edit pages.
4. Use `Toolbar` for search, filters, view switches, export/import, and primary actions.
5. Choose the main body component: `FullWidthTable`, `DataTable`, cards, `ListGroup`, charts, calendar, file, or chat.
6. Add feedback states: loading, empty, error, permission denied, success.
7. Put row actions in `KebabMenu` / `CellActions`; use `ConfirmationDialog` for destructive actions.
8. Put bulk actions in `ToolbarActions` or the table selection state, not scattered around the page.
9. Run a layout integrity check: full width, equal-height rows, no accidental large blank card areas, no mobile overflow.

## Layout Integrity

Decide the grid and height strategy before composing components. Do not stack arbitrary `div`s and hope the page fills correctly.

Rules:

- Page body should use `w-full`, `min-w-0`, `flex-1`, and `min-h-0` where needed so content can fill and shrink correctly.
- Dashboard bodies should usually use `grid grid-cols-12 gap-6 items-stretch`; cards in the same row should use `h-full`.
- If same-row cards have very different content density, do not leave a large blank area. Change the row span, split dense/sparse cards, or use `flex flex-col justify-between h-full` inside the sparse card.
- Card grids should use `auto-rows-fr` or explicit `min-h-[...]` values to avoid visual breaks.
- Charts need stable height, such as `h-[280px]`, `min-h-[320px]`, or `aspect-[16/9]`; do not let SVG/canvas natural height define the layout.
- Right-side todo/message/template cards placed next to large charts need enough visual density: footer actions, status summaries, grouped headings, or a smaller row span.
- Horizontal card groups should use responsive grid columns, not hand-written percentages. Common breakpoints: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4/5`.
- Any `overflow-y-auto` region needs a clear parent height or a `min-h-0` chain, otherwise scroll/fill behavior will break.

Self-check:

- Does the first viewport have one side full and the other side mostly empty?
- Are lower modules misaligned because previous row heights are inconsistent?
- Does the layout fill naturally at 1440px, 1920px, and mobile widths?
- Do CTAs, stats, list items, chart legends, and footers create a complete visual block inside each card?

## App Shell / Auth

- Use `AppLayout` for all authenticated admin pages; do not rebuild sidebar/topbar/profile navigation.
- Group navigation by business domain: dashboard, core objects, collaboration, finance, settings.
- Use `pageHeaderVariant="home"` for dashboards/lists and `pageHeaderVariant="detail"` for detail/edit/invoice/task pages.
- Use `Breadcrumbs` for nested resources.
- Forge currently has no auth template source. For login/signup/reset/invite pages, compose the skeleton from `TextField`, `Checkbox`, `Button`, and `StyledLink`.
- Auth forms should cover loading, validation error, disabled submit, and success redirect states.

## Dashboard

- First row: 3-5 KPIs with `StatCard` / `ProgressStatCard`.
- Middle: main chart + secondary chart with `ChartCard` and chart family components.
- Bottom: activity, top lists, map, or tasks with `ActivityCard`, `ListGroup`, `MapCard`, `TaskCard`.
- Keep labels short, show units, and use `trend` / `trendDirection` for movement.
- Dashboard/workbench cards should navigate to work: each KPI, anomaly, task, or shortcut should imply a filtered list, queue, detail page, or action.

## Analytics / Reporting

- Top: `Toolbar` with date range, dimension filters, export, refresh.
- Summary: `StatCard` for key metrics such as revenue, conversion, activity, cost, anomalies.
- Body: `ChartCard` + chart family for trend, comparison, and breakdown.
- Detail: `DataTable` under the charts for sortable/paginated records.
- Make the time range and filter context visible; reporting pages are not trustworthy without them.

## List Page

- Header: title + `primaryAction` for New/Create.
- Toolbar: search, status filter, date filter, tabs or view switch, export, bulk actions.
- Table: 6-8 columns; status uses `StatusBadge`; main entity uses image/avatar text cell; final column uses `KebabMenu` or `CellKebabMenu`.
- Use `FullWidthTable` for full-page management lists. Use `DataTable` for embedded dashboard/detail tables.
- Footer: `Pagination`.
- Actions: view detail, edit, duplicate, archive, delete. Delete must confirm.
- Keep search, filters, sort, page, pageSize, and view mode in URL when the list is an operational view users may share or revisit.
- Show bulk actions only after selection. For cross-page selection, clarify whether the action applies to current page or all matching records.
- For saved views such as "Overdue", "Needs review", or "My items", show the active segment and make clearing filters obvious.
- `ToolbarSearchInput` is display-only today. For controlled search that updates URL state, use `TextField` with a search icon or a project wrapper exposing `value` and `onChange`.

## Detail / Master-Detail

- Use detail header with back behavior and breadcrumbs.
- Top summary: status, owner, key dates, important metrics.
- Field groups: `DescriptionItem` in logical sections.
- Related data: `DataTable` / `ListGroup`; history/audit: `HistoryGrouped`.
- For master-detail workspaces, use left search/list and right preview/detail; collapse to list -> detail on mobile.

## Create / Edit / Import

- Section forms by business meaning: basic info, configuration, permissions, files, confirmation.
- Short forms are single column; complex forms may use two columns.
- File/image fields use `FileUpload`, `MediaUpload`, `ProfileImgUpload`.
- Multi-step flows use `Stepper`; final step shows a summary before submit.
- Import flows should be upload -> map fields -> preview validation -> confirm import.

## File Manager

- Toolbar: search, type filter, upload, create folder, view switch.
- Table view: `FullWidthTable` for name, type, size, owner, updated time, permission.
- Grid view: `FileCard` + `KebabMenu` for download, rename, move, delete.
- Use `FileUpload` for upload and `FileTypeIcon` for file type.
- Cover permissions, upload progress, failed retry, empty folder, and destructive delete confirmation.

## Invoice / Billing

- List: `FullWidthTable` with invoice id, client, project, amount, due date, status.
- Status: `StatusBadge` for paid, pending, overdue, draft, void.
- Detail: summary, company/client info, line items, totals, tax/discount, actions.
- Actions: send, download, print, edit, void/delete. Void/delete must confirm.

## Team / Members / Profile

- Directory: `DataTable` or `UserCard` grid with avatar, role, team, status, last active.
- Filters: role, status, team, permission group.
- Detail: profile, stats, projects, tasks, files, chat; switch sections with `TabBar`.
- Permission changes, member removal, and invite reset should confirm.

## Messages / Chat / Agent

- Conversation list: `ContactItem`.
- Message stream: `ChatBubble`.
- Composer: `ChatInputBar`.
- Results/artifacts should render as table, card, chart, file preview, or tabs, not only plain text.
- Cover empty, loading, error, and retry states.

## Calendar

- Toolbar + `ButtonGroup` for month/week/day.
- Main area: `FullCalendar`; side area can use `SmallCalendar` and today's `EventCard`s.
- Use `EventTag` for type/status.
- Event forms need title, time, participants, reminders, and recurrence when required.

## Settings

- Group settings into sections with `ListGroup`.
- Use `TabBar` for categories.
- Use `Toggle` for booleans, `SelectOption` for enums, `TextField` / `TextArea` for text.
- Put account deletion / reset / revoke actions in a separated danger zone with red confirmation.

## Audit / Activity

- Filter by time, actor, object, and action with toolbar controls.
- Use `HistoryGrouped` by date; use `HistoryItem` / `ActivityCard` for entries.
- Each entry should include actor, action, object, time, and result.
- For field changes, show before/after in compact descriptions.

## Search / States

- Search pages need search, category filters, sorting, result count, pagination, and empty state.
- Loading should keep the page frame stable.
- Empty state should explain why and offer create/upload/clear filters.
- Error state should offer retry.
- Permission state should say what access is missing without leaking sensitive data.
