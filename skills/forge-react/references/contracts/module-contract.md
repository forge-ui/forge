# Module Contract

Use this after the System Brief and before composing a core admin module.

The module contract defines the business object lifecycle, not the visual layout.

## Required Output

## Quality Bar

- Row actions should depend on object state. Avoid the same action set on every row.
- Detail must include related records or activity; a field-only detail page is incomplete.
- Create/edit forms should be grouped by business meaning, not by visual convenience.
- Dangerous actions must use `ConfirmationDialog` inside a real dialog shell.
- List state should be in URL when the view is operational or shareable.
